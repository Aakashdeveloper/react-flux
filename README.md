# Browserify Gulp Starter Kit
This contains the completed environment setup that we walk through in detail in module 2 of ["Building Applications with React and Flux" on Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com/author/cory-house).

This starter kit gives you the following out of the box:
- Browserify bundling
- Gulp build that:  
-- compiles JSX  
-- lints JS via ESLint  
-- bundles JS and CSS files  
-- migrates the built app to the dist folder  
-- reloads the browser upon save  
-- runs a dev webserver  
-- automatically opens the browser at your dev URL
- jQuery with Bootstrap for styling
- React, React Router, and Flux for ultra-responsive UI development

To get started:  
1. Install [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org)  
2. Download this repo and cd to the root directory of this repo on your machine  
3. Open the command line of your choice  
4. `npm install` - Installs the necessary packages  
5. `gulp` - Builds the project and opens your browser. Navigate to http://localhost:9005/ if your browser doesn't open automatically.

You're now all set to [follow along with the course](http://www.pluralsight.com/author/cory-house)!
